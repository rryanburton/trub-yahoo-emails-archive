These gummy stuff will stick up your mash and give you several\n&gt; heaaches and loooooong lauder times.  There are two ways around this.  One is\n&gt; to include a large handful of rice hulls in the mash or add extra grain and\n&gt; grind it faurly coursely.  The other is to include a beta-gluconase rest at\n&gt; 120 degrees F. for 30 minutes This will break these gums into shaller pieces.\n\nWhen I do a beta glucan rest (which is whenever I use oats, or lots \nof wheat, for the reasons Bill mentions) I do it at 104 degrees F\nfor 30 minutes.  This has always worked well for me.  I&#39;ve been \ntold that some microbreweries do a rest at 104 degress for as much\nas three hours.  I use 104 for the first rest based on the\nrecommendations of George Fix, author of several brewing textbooks, who\nvociferously advocates a 40-60-70 Celsius schedule (104-140-158 F, \n30 mins at each).  He claims that this will yeild maximum extraction\nfor most recipes, and a good balance between a- and b-amylase activity.\n\nAnd now that you mention it, does anyone know where to get rice hulls\naround here?  Mike at American Brewmaster ordered some for me but he\nhad trouble getting the order filled and they never arrived.  As\nan alternative, last time Cait and I brewed a Bavarian Weiss with\n50% wheat malt, we went to Southern States (the farm supply store)\nand got a big sack of &quot;table bran&quot; which is basically wheat husks,\nand used some of that as a filter aid in the grain bed.  We got \ngreat runoff, but somehwat reduced extraction efficiency.  I&#39;ll be\nbringing this beer to Trub tonight if anybody is interested in talking\nabout the technique.\n\nKevin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ZZZXXXZZZ\nSubscribe, unsubscribe, opt for a daily digest, or start a new e-group\nat http://www.eGroups.com -- Free Web-based e-mail groups.\n\n"}}
