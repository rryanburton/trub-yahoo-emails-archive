I especially enjoyed all of the Belgians and the Greenshields Oktoberfest and American\nWheat.  The nicest thing about this festival was that I didn&#39;t have to pour out any of the samples I tried; they were all good.\nGary&#39;s right about the Cottonwood beers, especially their IPA.  The worst part of the festival was that there were far too many good\nbeers (i.e., I had to skip quite a few).  Putting the sign outside the new ball park to direct the less observant of us (i.e.,\nmyself) was a good idea.  Even better would have been to include directions to the old ball park.  But I still had enough time to\nsample plenty, and I really liked that location - much better than the street outside the new ball park.\n\nAs far as the new list server is concerned, both notes that Gary wrote did not word wrap (i.e., each paragraph was displayed on a\nsingle, very long line) on my Netscape Communicator 4.04 under Windows 98.  Maybe we&#39;ll have to start hitting the enter key for each\nnew line.\n\nStephen Murphrey\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nSubscribe, unsubscribe, opt for a daily digest, or start a new e-group\nat http://www.eGroups.com -- Free Web-based e-mail groups.\n\n"}}
